# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

My name is Andre Jonathan, and I am currently in my Bachelor for Information Technology. I am from Indonesia and this is my second year in James Cook University, Singapore.

This Repository is filled with my attempt to do the practicals from CP1404 and the records of it.

Main lesson learnt on clean code:

- `ctrl` + `alt` + `L` to format the code 
- Reformat repeated code into a function to avoid repeating codes
- Comment code to understand what each code does (if the code is hard to explain)
