# CP1404 Practicals

- regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during
  the course of the subject?
I would normally finish these practicals in 2 to 3 sittings. This means that I would do the practicals for a week.
With these practicals, I did improve my accurate during the course because I get to understand more things here in this 
course.

- regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Reviewing other students have helped me in understanding certain concepts more since I get so look into it and apply it 
to my subsequent practicals. Getting feedback also helps me because by doing so, I get to improve and avoid the same 
mistakes in the future.

- regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would want to add sample output to questions that require many possible outputs since there will be a different in 
output per students. Having a sample output will help us with understanding what the code should do and what the teachers 
want from the students.
