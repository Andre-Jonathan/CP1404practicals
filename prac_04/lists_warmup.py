# numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]

# numbers[0]
# #It shows the first number in the list which is 3
# numbers[-1]
# #It shows the last number in the list which is 2
# numbers[3]
# It shows the fourth number in the list which is 1
# numbers[:-1]
# #It will show all the number in the list except 2
# numbers[3:4]
# #It will show the fourth number in the list which is 1
# 5 in numbers
# #It will show a boolean of True since there is a 5 in the list
# 7 in numbers
# #It will show a boolean of False since there is no 7 in the list
# "3" in numbers
# #It will show a boolean of False since even though there is an integer "3", there is no "3" in string
# numbers + [6, 5, 3]
# #It will add the new list to the numbers list.

# 1. Change the first element of numbers to "ten" (the string, not the number 10)
#    numbers[0] = "ten"
# 2. Change the last element of numbers to 1
#    numbers[-1] = 1
# 3. Print all the elements from numbers except the first two (slice)
#    print(numbers[2:]
# 4. Print whether 9 is an element of numbers
#    if 9 in numbers
